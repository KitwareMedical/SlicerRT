/// \class vtkPolyDataDistanceHistogramFilter
/// \brief Compute a histogram of distances from one poly data to another.
///
/// vtkPolyDataDistanceHistogramFilter is an algorithm that outputs a histogram
/// of the distances from one input vtkPolyData to another. This filter
/// is based on the following classes from vtk: vtkPolyDataPointSampler,
/// vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance. The histogram is output  as a vtkTable 
/// object. The user can also access the raw distances directly as a 
/// vtkDoubleArray using GetOutputDistances().
///
/// This class CANNOT be a part of the VTK pipeline (as a filter) because
/// it uses the pipeline internally. Creating such a "mini-pipeline" may
/// result in unexpected requests being sent up the pipeline and other
/// associated unexpected behaviour.
